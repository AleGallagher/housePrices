#  House Price Prediction

In this project we have a set of residential homes of Ames, Iowa. For each home we have features that describe the home, such as number of garages, fireplaces, etc.


The target of the project is predict the price of the house, so we are in front of a regression problem. We have two files, one for training the model and other for test it.


The main keys of the project are:
* Data preprocessing and cleaning.
* Data Visualization.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate and Multi Analysis).
* ML models for regression problem.
